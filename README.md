# Reddit-Redirect (Reddirect)
A small Firefox addon to redirect every reddit.com link to old.reddit.com.

Initially I named this project "Reddirect", but someone came up with the same clever name long before I did..

## Installation
### Building the extension
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FritzJo/reddit-redirect.git
cd reddit-redirect/src
zip -r -FS ../reddit-redirect.zip * --exclude "*.git*"
```
### Installing the extension
1. Open about:addons
2. Click on the "settings-icon"
3. Select "Install Add-on From File..."
4. Select the newly created reddit-redirect.zip
